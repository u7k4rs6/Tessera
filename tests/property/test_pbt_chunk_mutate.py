"""PBT-CHUNK-MUTATE, per 03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 4:

"for any chunk and any mutation, including truncation and extension, the
chunk is rejected before write."

`cas.write_verified` is the single choke point every chunk passes through
on both the fetch path (V8) and at publish time, so this property test
targets it directly rather than routing mutated bytes through the full
fetch pipeline -- the guarantee transfers, since `fetch_flow.py`'s V8 step
is just a caller of this same function.
