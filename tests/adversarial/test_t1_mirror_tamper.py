"""T1-MIRROR-TAMPER, per 03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 4:

"Malicious or compromised mirror serves altered weights or datasets...
Primary mitigation: every chunk hash-verified against the signed manifest
before write; peer blacklisted on mismatch."

This is the M2 behavioral headline: with a second, honest peer configured,
the fetch must SUCCEED (M1's single-peer fetch would have failed the whole
operation on the first mismatch). Peer selection in `peers.py` is
weighted-random with an exploration share, so which peer serves any given
chunk isn't deterministic across runs by default -- this test forces
determinism by monkeypatching the `random` calls `peers.py` makes, so the
tampering peer is guaranteed to be tried first (and therefore blacklisted)
rather than possibly getting skipped by chance.
