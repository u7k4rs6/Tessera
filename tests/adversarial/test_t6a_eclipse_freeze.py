"""T6A-ECLIPSE-FREEZE, per 03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 4:

"attacker controls all of a victim's peers and withholds fresh metadata.
Primary mitigation: freshness hard-fails when the TTL lapses (exit 30),
so an eclipse converts to a loud availability failure, never silent stale
data; metadata fetched from >=2 sources when configured; pinned mirrors
recommended."

Two sub-cases, both simulating "every configured peer is attacker-
controlled" via a multi-peer pool where NONE of the peers can produce a
fresh, obtainable timestamp: (a) peers serve a genuinely expired but
validly-signed timestamp (the literal "freeze" -- a statement that was
once legitimate but has since lapsed); (b) peers have no timestamp at all
obtainable (StaleError's "no timestamp obtainable" path). Both must fail
loud with exit 30 and V4 as the failing check, never silently accept
stale metadata, and never hang regardless of how many eclipsing peers are
configured -- `_try_each_peer` (fetch_flow.py) already bounds this to one
pass per peer with no retry loop.
