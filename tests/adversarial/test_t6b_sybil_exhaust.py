"""T6B-SYBIL-EXHAUST, per 03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 4:

"attacker spins up many fake mirrors serving garbage or nothing. Primary
mitigation: endpoint verification makes Sybils unable to poison; per-peer
scoring, session blacklists on digest mismatch, and bounded retries cap
wasted bandwidth; no open DHT exists to capture."

15 Sybils (8 withholding -- real servers with nothing published at all,
an instant 404/NetworkError on every request -- and 7 corrupting -- real
servers with ONLY the target chunk digest present, and wrong bytes at it,
an instant 200-with-wrong-bytes/DigestMismatchError for that one request)
plus 1 honest peer, 16 total. Every Sybil fails INSTANTLY: neither flavor
ever accepts a connection and stalls, which would cost up to
REQUEST_TIMEOUT's 30s per attempt and risk a pathologically slow (or,
with a badly-built fixture, effectively hanging) test -- see
DECISIONS.md. `max_attempts = max(2 * len(pool.base_urls), 2)`
(fetch_flow.py) is 32 for 16 peers; at loopback speed with instant-
failing peers this stays comfortably sub-second.
