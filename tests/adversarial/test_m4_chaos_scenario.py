"""M4 chaos scenario, per 03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 9: "a chaos
scenario combining T1, T2b, and T6a simultaneously against one fetch."

T1 (tampering mirror), T2b (stale/superseded mirror), and T6a (withholding/
eclipsing peers) are all configured in the SAME `PeerPool` at once, rather
than each proven in isolation as their own dedicated adversarial test.

Two variants, against the same evolving setup: publish v1, reissue
timestamp (seq 1), consumer fetches v1 (establishes the timestamp
high-water mark at seq 1) through the plain honest origin. `shutil.
copytree` the origin store at this exact point -- peer `S`, T2b's frozen,
once-legitimate-now-superseded state. Publish v2, reissue timestamp
(seq 2) on the live store (signed by a second release key delegated via a
root v2 -- `published_artifact`'s original release private key isn't
exposed by the fixture, and a same-keys root bump needs only the already-
exposed root key to self-sign, matching the M3 "revoke" ceremony's
same-keys-unchanged reasoning).

- **Variant A** (an honest peer survives among the chaos): the consumer,
  still only at hwm=1, fetches v2 through a pool of `T` (T1, `conftest.py`'s
  `TamperingProxy` in front of the live honest origin `H`, corrupting v2's
  target chunk, `random` monkeypatched exactly as `test_t1_mirror_tamper.py`
  does to force it tried and blacklisted deterministically), `H` itself,
  `E1-E3` (T6a, real servers with nothing published -- instant
  NetworkError everywhere), and `S` (T2b, offers seq=1 which merely
  matches the not-yet-advanced hwm -- an honest, once-current, just-older
  snapshot, not a rollback or equivocation; ordered last so metadata
  resolution reaches `T`/`H` first rather than locking onto `S`'s v2-less
  state and failing the whole fetch at V6 before an honest source is ever
  tried). Must succeed: exit 0, correct bytes materialized, `T` blacklisted
  with a large score penalty and scored strictly worse than `H`. This also
  advances the consumer's hwm to seq 2.
- **Variant B** (total chaos, no honest peer left): the SAME consumer,
  now at hwm=2 after Variant A, is pointed at a pool of only `E1-E3` and
  `S` -- and this time `S`'s frozen seq=1 IS a rollback relative to the
  consumer's own advanced hwm. Every peer must fail; the fetch must fail
  loud (never silently accept `S`'s now-stale-relative-to-what-this-
  consumer-has-already-seen state), never hang, and materialize nothing
  new.
