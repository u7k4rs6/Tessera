"""Quarantine: evidence capture on verification failure.

Per 03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 7: on any verification failure that
involved received bytes, the offending material moves to
`quarantine/<utc-timestamp>-<code>/` containing the bytes, the expected and
actual digests, the peer identity/URL, and a machine-readable `report.json`.
Quarantine is evidence, never input: nothing in this codebase ever reads
bytes back out of quarantine into a verification path.
