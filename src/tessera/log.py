"""Transparency log primitives, per 02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 4.3
and 03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 6 (V7).

RFC 6962-style append-only Merkle tree: every publish, rotation, and
revocation appends a leaf; the publisher signs checkpoints (tree size +
root hash) with the release key (no new role -- D5's three roles stay
fixed). This module is pure Merkle math and DSSE checkpoint shape, with NO
I/O -- `originstore.py` owns persistence, `freshness.py` owns the
network-fetch-then-verify orchestration.

Two proof types:
- Inclusion proof: "this leaf is really in the tree at this size" --
  implemented as the standard RFC 6962 O(log n) audit path.
- Consistency proof: "this newer tree is a genuine append-only extension
  of a tree I've already checkpointed" -- implemented here as the full
  ordered list of leaf hashes up to the new size (O(n), not RFC 6962's
  O(log n) SUBPROOF construction). This is a deliberate simplification:
  it gives the identical security property (any inconsistency between an
  old and a claimed-newer checkpoint is detected) with much simpler, more
  obviously-correct code, and at the modest per-publisher leaf counts
  this system handles the size difference isn't practically significant.
  D7 commits to "client-side proofs" and equivocation detection, not
  byte-for-byte RFC 6962 conformance.

Domain-separated hashing (leaf vs. internal node) follows RFC 6962 exactly
(0x00 / 0x01 prefixes) even though the consistency-proof simplification
above doesn't, since domain separation is what prevents a leaf being
mistaken for an internal node hash (a second-preimage class of attack on
naive Merkle trees) and costs nothing to keep.
