"""Timestamp statement, per 02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 4.2.

Tiny, short-lived, and reissued independently of `publish` (03's role
separation: the timestamp key is meant to live on a different, more
frequently-online host than the release key). Signed the same way as the
root document -- a DSSE envelope over canonical JSON -- so the trust-
relevant bytes live inside the envelope's base64 `payload` field, immune to
outer-JSON reformatting. Contrast with `snapshot.py`, which is NOT signed
this way (see that module's docstring).

This module implements only the crypto+expiry half of V4
(03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 6): signature validity and freshness.
The high-water-mark/equivocation half of V4 is `trust_store.py`'s job,
orchestrated together by `freshness.py`.
