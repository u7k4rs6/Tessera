"""`verify PATH --ref REF`, per 02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 7 and
03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 6: V1, V2, V6 (manifest from cache or
network), then V8 and V9 recomputed over local bytes already on disk.
Never mutates `verified/` -- this command answers "is this file the signed
artifact?", it does not materialize anything.

Deliberately does NOT enforce the rollback high-water marks `fetch_flow.py`
does: `verify` checks a specific, named reference against what the
publisher signed for it, which is a legitimate thing to ask about an old
version long after a newer one exists (e.g. auditing an old backup). hwm
enforcement is about "give me the current, freshest artifact" -- `fetch`'s
job, not this one -- so `verify` never calls
`trust_store.check_and_advance_*` and always passes the default
`min_version=0`/`min_seq=0`.

Only the network-fallback path (nothing cached, a client was given) runs
V4/V5/V7/V10 (`freshness.py`) to resolve an uncached reference via the
signed snapshot, exactly like `fetch_flow.py` -- there is no other
mechanism left to do that resolution now that the M1 `/current` bridge is
gone. The common case (a reference already fetched once) stays fully
offline and never touches V4/V5/V7/V10 at all.

V2's cache-miss path walks the FULL root chain from genesis
(`freshness.fetch_verified_root_chain`), exactly like `fetch_flow.py` --
NOT `root.verify_root_doc` directly against the fresh network response,
which that function's own docstring warns is unsafe (T4A: nothing would
otherwise check that the served document is really signed by the pinned
fingerprint's own key, only that it's self-consistent). The cache-HIT path
still uses `verify_root_doc`, which is exactly the safe, documented use
for it: a defense-in-depth re-check of a document that was already
chain-verified once, when it was cached.

Revocation is retroactive (D13), so `revoked_keys` -- derived from
whichever root document V2 lands on, cached or freshly chain-walked -- is
threaded into every subsequent signature check (V4, V6, V7, V10) exactly
like `fetch_flow.py`, even on the fully-offline cached path: a manifest
cached before its signer was revoked must still fail once that revocation
is known.
