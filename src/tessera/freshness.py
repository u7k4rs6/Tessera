"""V4, V5, and (M3) V7 orchestration, shared by `fetch_flow.py` and
`verify_flow.py`.

`fetch_verified_timestamp` is V4 end to end: fetch the timestamp envelope,
verify its signature/expiry (`timestamp.verify_timestamp_envelope`), then
check it against the consumer's persisted rollback/equivocation state
(`trust_store.check_and_advance_timestamp_seq`). `fetch_verified_snapshot`
is V5: fetch the snapshot's raw bytes by digest and confirm they hash to
it (`snapshot.verify_snapshot`).

`fetch_verified_root_chain` always re-fetches and re-walks the FULL root
chain from genesis (version 1) through whatever version the origin
currently serves, rather than resuming from a cached head -- simpler, and
at the modest root-version counts a real deployment accumulates (each
document is small; rotations are rare events), not a meaningful cost.

V7 (transparency log) is two independent checks, both implemented here:
`fetch_verified_checkpoint` verifies a consistency proof from the
consumer's OWN previously-stored checkpoint to the current one (detects a
single source going backwards or rewriting its own history over time);
`cross_check_checkpoints` compares the primary checkpoint against every
OTHER configured peer's checkpoint IN THE SAME SESSION, sequentially over
`pool.clients_by_score()` (same precedent as M2 Open Decision 6, not
concurrent) -- this is what actually catches a publisher/attacker showing
different victims different "latest" states at the same moment (T5B),
which the single-source-over-time check alone cannot.
`fetch_verified_inclusion` verifies the specific manifest being fetched is
really a leaf in the checkpointed tree.
