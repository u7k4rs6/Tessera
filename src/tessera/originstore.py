"""On-disk layout for an origin's published state, layered on top of the
shared CAS (`store.py`/`cas.py`).

Chunks are content-addressed and therefore publisher-agnostic, living in the
shared `objects/` tree. Manifest envelopes are served by
`GET /v1/manifest/{digest}` with no publisher segment in the route
(02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 6.1), so they are stored flat, keyed
only by the manifest digest -- any publisher's manifest is reachable by its
digest alone, matching the route exactly. Root documents, the timestamp,
and the snapshot ARE namespaced by publisher (the root key fingerprint,
since there is no naming authority per section 2) because their routes
carry a `{publisher}` segment.

`current_pointer_path`/`write_current_pointer`/`read_current_pointer` are
the on-disk bookkeeping `publish` writes for every release (per-artifact
"what does this version's manifest digest look like"). In M1 these were
also served directly over HTTP as a trust-free resolution bridge; from M2
that HTTP route is gone (superseded by the signed snapshot) and this data
is purely internal input for `origin reissue-timestamp` to enumerate when
building a snapshot -- see `list_artifacts`/`list_versions`.

Snapshot bytes are written and read RAW (`atomic_write_bytes`/
`.read_bytes()`), never through `atomic_write_json`/`read_json`, per the
byte-exactness requirement in `snapshot.py`'s docstring: re-serializing
through `json.dumps` would silently change the bytes a digest was computed
over.

The transparency log (M3) is stored as a single atomic JSON array
(`log/leaves.json`) plus the latest checkpoint (`log/checkpoint.json`) and
a per-tree-size checkpoint history (`log/checkpoint/<size>.json`) --
`append_log_leaf` is lock-protected exactly like `next_seq`/
`next_timestamp_seq`, since allocating the next leaf index and re-signing
the checkpoint must be atomic against a concurrent publish/rotate/revoke.
This is a deliberate simplification from the architecture doc's framing of
log leaves as individually content-addressed objects that mirrors
replicate automatically like any other content (DECISIONS.md, log storage
decision): a single JSON array is simpler and matches D9's "inspectable
JSON over cleverness" philosophy, at the cost of `mirror sync` needing an
explicit added step to pull the log rather than getting it "for free" the
way it walks chunks.
