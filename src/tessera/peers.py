"""Multi-peer fetch pool: persistent scoring and session blacklisting, per
02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 6.2.

Every chunk is still hash-verified before it touches the CAS regardless of
which peer served it (`cas.write_verified` is unchanged) -- this module
only decides *which* peer to ask next and *how much to trust* a peer for
future sessions. A digest mismatch is a hard, immediate signal (the peer
served bad bytes): it blacklists that peer for the rest of this session and
persists a large score penalty right away, so even a crash mid-fetch
doesn't lose that signal. A transport error (timeout, connection refused,
5xx) is a much weaker signal (could be a blip, could be overload) and only
deprioritizes the peer, saved at the end of the session along with any
successes. Selection is weighted-random with a small exploration share, so
a peer that was bad in a past session isn't permanently locked out --
scores are clamped to keep that exploration share meaningful at both ends.
