"""Dataset record index and diff, per 02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 3.4.

v1 supports JSONL specifically: a per-file index of record digests at
configurable granularity (one digest per line, or one digest per block of
N lines). This is T3B's detective mitigation for publisher-signed poison:
injected/duplicated samples and label flips between versions become
enumerable, attributable facts tied to a signed release, rather than
something hidden inside a multi-gigabyte blob.

The diff is positional (record i in the old index vs. record i in the new
one), matching how JSONL datasets actually evolve (mostly appended to, so
"modified" means "the record at this position changed," not "this exact
content moved somewhere else").
