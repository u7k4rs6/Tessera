"""Local trust pins, per 02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 2 and section 8.

A human-friendly publisher name is a purely local alias for a pinned root
key fingerprint, created by `trust add` -- exactly like an SSH
`known_hosts` entry. There is no global naming authority; the pin is the
trust bootstrap and this module is where it lives on disk.

Also holds the consumer's rollback high-water marks (03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md
section 4.2, section 6 V2/V4/V6): the root document version, the timestamp
seq (plus equivocation detection), and each artifact's manifest seq, all
persisted per pinned publisher in `state.json`. This is the consumer's
*acceptance floor* -- a separate concern from `originstore.next_seq`, which
is the *publisher's* seq-assignment authority at publish time; the two
share no code, only the number that flows from one into the other via
`min_seq`/`min_version` parameters at verification time.
