"""The manifest: the signed statement "this artifact is exactly these bytes",
per 02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 3.3.

This is the core M1 deliverable. `verify_manifest_envelope` implements
check V6 from 03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 6: signature under an
authorized key, canonical-form payload, digest match, embedded
publisher/name/version match against what was requested (so a compromised
resolution step can never remap a reference to a different, legitimately
signed manifest), a per-artifact rollback high-water mark (M2), and key
revocation (M3, D13: a revoked key's signature is rejected everywhere,
including on manifests that would otherwise verify).
