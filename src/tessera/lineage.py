"""Lineage walk, per 02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md section 5 and
04_FRONTEND_SPEC.md's `provenance` command.

Defaults to metadata-only (Decision 9 in the M3 plan): each node's root,
manifest, and provenance attestation (if any) are verified, but chunk
bytes are never pulled unless that node's artifact is already
materialized in `verified/`, or `--deep` is given (which pulls it via the
real `fetch` pipeline, turning that node into a materialized one). A
max_depth + visited-ref guard protects against cyclic materials graphs --
a valid signature proves who asserted an edge, not that the graph it
describes is acyclic.

A node whose resolution fails (network error, not found, revoked, an
uncached/unpinned publisher) is a leaf carrying an `error` instead of
recursing further -- a broken edge doesn't abort the whole walk, since
lineage is a report for a human to read, not a pass/fail check like
`fetch`/`verify`.
