"""Content-addressed object store.

Every object Tessera ever writes under `objects/` (a chunk, a manifest, a
root document) is bounded in size by protocol: chunks are exactly
CHUNK_SIZE (4 MiB) or shorter, and metadata documents are kilobytes. This is
what keeps `write_verified` at O(chunk size) memory as required by
01_PRD.md's performance criterion -- nothing in this codebase ever calls it
with a whole multi-gigabyte artifact's bytes at once; file assembly (V9)
concatenates already-verified chunk objects on disk instead.

`write_verified` is the single choke point through which bytes cross from
"received, unverified" to "on disk, trusted": it hashes first and only
writes to the final content-addressed path on a match. A digest mismatch
never touches the final path at all -- the bytes go to quarantine instead.
This function is both the V8 check (03_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS.md section 6) and
the target of the PBT-CHUNK-MUTATE property test.
