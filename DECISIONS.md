# Tessera: Decision Log

Seeded from the architecture doc's decision log (section 12), renamed
Custody -> Tessera, plus the M1-specific decisions made while implementing
this milestone. New decisions get appended here as the project grows.

## Carried over from the design docs

- **D1** BLAKE3 over SHA-256. Verification is the hot path; BLAKE3 is
  SIMD-optimized and parallelizes across cores. The `b3:` prefix keeps a
  future algorithm migration (or a secondary digest for interop) from
  breaking the format.
- **D2** Fixed 4 MiB chunks over content-defined chunking. Simplicity and a
  simple fetch scheduler now; cross-version dataset dedup is deferred until
  there's real traffic to tune against.
- **D3** A flat, ordered chunk-digest list per file rather than a Merkle
  tree with per-chunk proofs. Manifests are small enough to fetch whole; a
  flat list is harder to get wrong.
- **D4** RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical JSON inside DSSE envelopes. Kills an
  entire class of canonicalization-bypass bugs; DSSE is small, reviewed,
  and already used by in-toto/sigstore.
- **D5** Three key roles (offline root, online release, online timestamp).
  The minimum role set the threat model needs.
- **D6** The snapshot is digest-bound to the timestamp rather than
  separately signed. One fewer online key; freshness comes from the
  timestamp's TTL, integrity from the digest.
- **D7** A single publisher-operated transparency log with client-side
  inclusion/consistency proofs and cross-source checkpoint comparison,
  rather than third-party witnesses or a ledger.
- **D8** A thin custom HTTP layer over libtorrent/IPFS/libp2p. The trust
  layer is custom regardless of transport choice; a custom layer keeps
  every verification decision in auditable project code.
- **D9** JSON/TOML state files with atomic rename; no database. Every state
  file stays human-inspectable during adversarial debugging.
- **D10** Python 3.11+ for M1-M4 (native-speed hashing via the `blake3`
  binding, Hypothesis for property-based adversarial tests, rapid
  iteration). Rust is noted as a post-M4 option for a standalone mirror
  daemon only.
- **D11** No unverified fetch path exists anywhere in the design. Tested,
  not just documented (see `tests/unit/test_no_bypass.py`).
- **D12** Publisher naming is local pinning; no global registry. A registry
  would reintroduce the central trust root the system exists to remove.

## M1-specific decisions

- **D13** `keygen --role timestamp` is implemented generically for all
  three roles in M1, even though nothing consumes a timestamp document
  yet. Same Ed25519+scrypt code path per role; costs nothing now and saves
  a rework when M2 adds the timestamp signer.
- **D14** `publisher init`/`publisher delegate` take `--root-key` directly
  and sign inline, rather than the export/sign/import ceremony shown for
  `rotate`/`revoke` in the frontend spec. That ceremony exists to support
  an air-gapped root across a multi-step *rotation* flow (M3); M1 has no
  rotation or chain-walking and a 1-of-1 threshold, so splitting the
  ceremony now would be complexity with nothing yet to justify it.
- **D15** `publish` does not accept `--base`/`--dataset`/`--code`
  provenance flags in M1. `provenance` is always `null` on the M1
  manifest; silently accepting flags that imply lineage recording while
  doing nothing with them would violate the "loud, specific" failure/UX
  principle. An unrecognized flag is a clean usage error (exit 2) until M3
  actually builds attestations.
- **D16** The `GET /v1/{publisher}/current/{name}/{version}` endpoint
  (`resolve.py`) is an M1-only bridge from a version reference to a
  manifest digest, standing in for the signed snapshot/timestamp
  resolution flow M2 introduces. It carries no trust weight: the manifest
  it points to is independently verified (V6) regardless of what this
  bridge returns, so a wrong or malicious value here can only cause a
  failed fetch, never an accepted bad artifact.

## M2-specific decisions

- **D17** The snapshot keeps every published version (`versions: {version:
  {...}}` plus a `current_version` pointer), not just the current one.
  V6's own spec text says the snapshot "maps name@version to a manifest
  digest," not "name to its current version," and M1 already supported
  fetching any historical version by exact ref; dropping that would be a
  silent regression. `originstore`'s existing `current/<artifact>/<version>`
  bookkeeping already holds exactly this data, so `origin
  reissue-timestamp` just enumerates it.
- **D18** The M1 `/current` bridge is removed outright (route, `resolve.py`,
  `OriginClient.get_current`), not kept as a fallback. It carried zero
  trust weight even in M1 (D16), there are no external consumers pre-1.0
  to stay compatible with, and a dead trust-adjacent HTTP endpoint is a
  liability (attack surface, a foot-gun if something is ever miswired back
  to it) rather than a convenience.
- **D19** Peer scores (`peers.py`) are clamped to `[-50, +20]`. Unbounded
  scores make weighted-random selection degenerate at both ends: an old,
  very-good peer would be picked almost deterministically forever, and a
  once-bad peer would need an implausibly long good streak to matter
  again, defeating the "small exploration share so a formerly bad mirror
  can rehabilitate" requirement (architecture doc section 6.2).
- **D20** `verify` never enforces the rollback high-water marks `fetch`
  does, and never advances the per-artifact manifest-seq hwm. `verify`
  checks a specific, named reference against what the publisher signed for
  it, a legitimate thing to ask about an old version long after a newer
  one exists (e.g. auditing an old backup). hwm enforcement is about
  "give me the current, freshest artifact," which is `fetch`'s job. (The
  timestamp hwm does still advance as a side effect of `verify`'s network-
  fallback path, since that's about detecting a stale/equivocating
  overall snapshot pointer, not about which artifact version is being
  checked, a different, orthogonal concern.)
- **D21** Metadata resolution (V2 root, V4 timestamp, V5 snapshot, V6
  manifest) falls back across every configured peer in score order
  (`_try_each_peer` in `fetch_flow.py`) rather than pinning to one peer or
  requiring all configured peers to agree. Each document is independently
  verified regardless of which peer served it, so a bad, down, or
  malicious-but-unsuccessful peer there only costs availability/score,
  never correctness. This is also what makes a T4A-shaped lookalike-root
  attempt or a T2B-shaped stale-mirror attempt fail over to an honest peer
  automatically when one is configured, rather than failing the whole
  operation.
- **D22** Timestamp reissue is a fully separate command
  (`origin reissue-timestamp`), never folded into `publish`. Matches D5's
  role-separation philosophy (release and timestamp keys are meant to live
  on different hosts in a real deployment) and gives the TTL-driven
  reissue cadence, needed even with zero new publishes, an obviously
  correct home instead of being bolted onto an unrelated command.
- **D23** `mirror sync`'s ingest checks are real where they can be
  (chunk-by-digest via `cas.write_verified`, snapshot-bytes-by-digest) but
  only shape/self-consistency checks for root/timestamp/manifest, since a
  mirror holds no pin and therefore has no trusted key to verify a
  signature against. This is by design, not a shortcut: per the PRD, a
  mirror's ingest verification exists only to avoid caching obviously
  corrupt garbage and is never trust-relevant to a downstream consumer,
  who verifies everything itself, from a mirror or an origin, identically.

## M3-specific decisions

- **D24** Revocation is retroactive and fail-closed with no time-based
  carve-out (security doc section 5.5): a cryptographically valid
  signature from a key in the accumulated `revoked_keys` set is rejected
  everywhere (manifest, timestamp, checkpoint, provenance), even on a
  document that would otherwise verify cleanly, and even if the signature
  predates the revocation. `root.py`'s `revoked` field is cumulative
  (each new root version copies forward every prior revocation and
  appends any new one), so a single verified root document's own
  `revoked` list is always the FULL revocation history up to that
  version; no need to re-walk the whole chain to know what's revoked,
  only to know the chain itself is legitimate.
- **D25** Revocation propagation is exactly one hop later than the
  cross-signature that authorized it: `verify_root_link` for hop N->N+1
  is checked against the `revoked_keys` accumulated BEFORE that hop;
  N+1's own new revocations are unioned in only after the hop succeeds.
  Otherwise a root could never revoke the very key it just used to sign
  its own rotation into existence.
- **D26** Three explicitly-scoped root verification entry points
  (`verify_root_genesis`, `verify_root_link`, `verify_root_chain`, plus
  the pre-M3 `verify_root_doc`), not one function with a mode flag. Which
  one is safe to call depends entirely on the trust boundary of the input
  (a fresh, fully-untrusted network response vs. a document already
  chain-verified once and now only being re-checked against local cache
  tampering). Collapsing them into one function with a boolean would
  make it easy to accidentally call the unsafe one on untrusted input.
  Doing exactly that in `verify_flow.py`'s network-fallback path was a
  real, latent T4A gap this milestone's flag day closed: that path
  previously called `verify_root_doc` (self-consistency only, no check
  that the served document is really signed by the PINNED fingerprint's
  own key) directly against a fresh network response, instead of the
  safe genesis+chain-walk.
- **D27** The transparency log is stored as one atomic JSON array
  (`log/leaves.json`) plus a checkpoint (`log/checkpoint.json` +
  per-tree-size history), lock-protected exactly like `next_seq`, rather
  than the architecture doc's literal framing of individually
  content-addressed leaves that mirrors replicate "for free." A single
  JSON array is simpler and matches D9's "inspectable JSON over
  cleverness" philosophy; the cost is that `mirror sync` needs one
  explicit added step (fetch+replicate `checkpoint.json` and
  `log/leaves.json` via a new `GET .../log/leaves` route, added
  specifically because no existing route exposed raw leaves) instead of
  picking the log up automatically the way it walks chunks and
  manifests. O(n) rewrite per publish is a known, documented scaling
  limit, not a blocker at CLI scale.
- **D28** Consistency proofs are the full ordered leaf-hash list up to
  the new size (O(n)), not RFC 6962's O(log n) SUBPROOF construction.
  Same security property (any inconsistency between an old and a
  claimed-newer checkpoint is detected), much simpler and more obviously
  correct code, and the asymptotic gap isn't meaningful at the leaf
  counts a single publisher accumulates. Inclusion proofs ARE the real
  RFC 6962 O(log n) audit path; that one is cheap and correct to do
  properly, and every fetch needs it, so the simplification is scoped
  specifically to the operation (consistency checks) that's rare and
  small in practice.
- **D29** Checkpoints are signed with the release key, no new role (D5's
  three-role model stays fixed). A provenance attestation's `subject`
  binds to `manifest.content_digest()` (the manifest's canonical bytes
  with `provenance` forced to `null`) rather than the manifest's own
  final digest (with `provenance` populated). Binding to the final digest
  is circular: the manifest's digest depends on what's inside it,
  including the provenance pointer, which itself depends on the subject
  digest it's being computed for. Binding to the pre-provenance content
  digest breaks the cycle while still tying the attestation to the exact
  file/chunk content being attested to.
- **D30** `publish`'s `--base`/`--dataset`/`--code` provenance flags
  resolve materials ONLY from the local trust cache
  (`trust_store.load_cached_manifest`), never the network, continuing
  D22's role-separation principle that a publish host shouldn't need live
  network access to sign a release. An uncached reference is a clean
  usage error naming `tessera fetch` as the remedy, not a silent network
  fetch mid-publish.
- **D31** `record_index` is keyed per-file (`{relative_path:
  [record_digest, ...]}`) at the manifest's top level, built only for
  `.jsonl` files when `--records` is non-`none` and the artifact type is
  `dataset`; other extensions stay opaque even with `--records` set,
  since v1 only knows how to delimit JSONL. `tessera diff` reports
  per-file status (`added`/`removed`/positional diff) rather than
  refusing when the two versions' file sets don't match exactly.
- **D32** `tessera status`'s materialized-but-revoked marking is a pure
  reconciliation, never a re-verification or a deletion: `fetch_flow`
  writes a `.tessera-status.json` breadcrumb (manifest digest + signer
  key id) into each materialized artifact directory at fetch time;
  `status` cross-references breadcrumbs against a FRESHLY fetched
  current root's revoked-key set (never a cached one, since the whole
  point is to catch a revocation the consumer hasn't fetched anything
  new since) and reports, but never touches, the artifact on disk,
  matching the security doc's framing that refusing a flagged artifact
  is a caller policy decision, not something this layer enforces.
- **D33** `tessera provenance`'s lineage walk defaults to metadata-only
  (root, manifest, and attestation verified; no chunk bytes pulled)
  unless `--deep` is given, which pulls each unmaterialized node via the
  real `fetch` pipeline. A `max_depth` (default 5) plus a visited-ref set
  guard against cyclic materials graphs: a valid signature on a
  `materials` entry proves who asserted the edge, not that the graph it
  describes is acyclic. A node that fails to resolve is a leaf carrying
  an `error`, not a reason to abort the whole walk: lineage is a report
  for a human, not a pass/fail gate.
- **D34** `publish --resign-all` also re-signs the CURRENT transparency-
  log checkpoint (same tree_size/root_hash, fresh signature only) with
  the new release key, not just the manifests. This was a real gap found
  during end-to-end testing: without it, if the stored checkpoint
  happened to be signed by the very release key being revoked, V7 (log
  freshness) would stay broken for every consumer until some unrelated
  future publish/rotate/revoke happened to refresh the checkpoint,
  defeating `--resign-all`'s entire purpose as the recovery path after a
  release-key compromise.
- **D35** `publisher delegate` resolves the publisher's permanent
  identity via the stored `publisher/` directory layout and bumps
  whatever the current root version is, rather than assuming (as the
  pre-M3 implementation did) that the CURRENT root key's own id is the
  same value as the publisher's permanent fingerprint. That assumption
  only holds before any rotation has ever happened; found and fixed
  during end-to-end testing of a delegate-after-rotate ceremony.

## M4-specific decisions

- **D36** "Equivocation cross-checks" (the milestone-table bullet) means
  extending M3's `cross_check_checkpoints` pattern to the TIMESTAMP only,
  not the root document. `02_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` section 6.2
  states the design's own promise precisely: "Freshness metadata
  (`timestamp`, `log/checkpoint`) is fetched from at least two
  independent sources when two or more are configured... two valid
  statements with the same `seq` but different contents [is]
  equivocation evidence." M3 built this for the log but never for the
  timestamp itself, a real gap against the architecture doc's own stated
  design. Root gets no analogous check: TUF-style cross-signing already
  makes two divergent-but-both-valid root histories require actual root
  key compromise, which section 5.6 documents as unrecoverable by any
  automatic mechanism. A same-session cross-source root check would be
  new code defending against a scenario the threat model says code
  cannot fix. `freshness.cross_check_timestamps` mirrors
  `cross_check_checkpoints`'s exact shape (sequential over
  `pool.clients_by_score()`, no concurrency, same M2/M3 precedent), wired
  into `fetch_flow.py`'s V4 block.
- **D37** Compromise-playbook drills are scripted end-to-end tests of the
  section 5.6 recovery procedures, not new mechanism. The release-key
  playbook was already fully drilled by the M3 ceremony test; M4 adds the
  timestamp-key drill (revoke, then rotate, then reissue) and the root-key drill
  (the only code-testable surface of an inherently manual, out-of-band
  procedure: re-pinning an existing local alias to a brand-new,
  unrelated fingerprint via `trust add`).
- **D38** `THREAT_COVERAGE.md` is a hand-maintained markdown table (no
  new tooling), matching `DECISIONS.md`'s existing convention, populated
  cumulatively across all four milestones rather than as an M4-only
  artifact: section 9's "each checkpoint report" language is cumulative,
  and a report that only covered the newest milestone's tests would be a
  worse, less useful document than one line-item lookup covering the
  whole threat table at once.
- **D39** The chaos scenario (T1+T2b+T6a combined against one fetch) and
  T6B-SYBIL-EXHAUST's 16-peer topology both reuse existing adversarial
  fixture techniques verbatim (`TamperingProxy`, `shutil.copytree`-frozen
  stale stores, empty/corrupted-chunk-only stores) rather than inventing
  new fixture machinery. Two real behavioral subtleties, not code bugs,
  had to be designed around and are documented directly in the test
  files: (a) `PeerPool` scores persist across fetch calls sharing a home
  directory, so a prior successful fetch gives a peer a score head start
  that can starve a later test's other configured peers of ever being
  exercised at all; (b) a peer whose state honestly matches the
  consumer's NOT-YET-ADVANCED high-water mark doesn't error at V2/V4/V5
  (it's an older-but-valid snapshot, not a rollback or equivocation);
  if tried before a more-current peer, metadata resolution locks onto its
  stale state and the whole fetch fails at V6 before an honest peer is
  ever reached, so peer-list insertion order (ties break by it when
  scores are tied) has to put the intended-to-win peer first.
- **D40** Two parser-robustness bugs were found by pre-reading every
  entry point M4's fuzzing mandate names, before writing the fuzz tests
  that would otherwise immediately fail on them: (1) `timestamp.py`,
  `log.py`, `manifest.py`, and `provenance.py` all lacked the
  `isinstance(parsed, dict)` guard `root.py::_decode_envelope_payload`
  already had, so a validly-signed payload of e.g. `b'null'` crashed with
  a raw `AttributeError` on `.get()` instead of raising a `TesseraError`,
  reachable by a malicious/compromised key holder (section 5.6, T3b),
  not just a network attacker. (2) `log.py::verify_inclusion`/
  `verify_consistency` passed attacker-controlled proof elements straight
  into `hashing.parse_b3`, which raises a bare `ValueError` rather than a
  `TesseraError`, letting a malformed proof from a malicious peer crash
  the whole `fetch` process. Both fixed ahead of the fuzz-test-writing
  step.
- **D41** Parser fuzzing itself (run at both the default 100-example
  budget and an opt-in 1000-example "thorough" `tests/conftest.py`
  profile, across several random seeds) found three MORE real crash bugs
  beyond the two in D40, the "budgeted, expected work" the milestone's
  own framing anticipated, not scope creep:
  1. Every `rfc8785` exception (including `IntegerDomainError`, for
     integers outside JCS's safe range) is a `ValueError` subclass, but
     `canonicalize()` was called OUTSIDE every affected module's existing
     `except ValueError` block (only `json.loads` was wrapped), so a
     validly-signed payload containing a too-large integer crashed the
     whole fetch process. Fixed centrally: `canonical.py` gains
     `is_canonical(obj, payload) -> bool`, catching `ValueError` and
     returning `False` rather than raising; every affected call site
     (manifest.py, timestamp.py, log.py, provenance.py, root.py) uses it
     instead of a bare `canonicalize(...) != payload` comparison.
     `snapshot.py` already wrapped its call correctly and needed no
     change; the inconsistency between it and the other five modules is
     exactly why a centralized helper, not five independent try/except
     blocks, is the right fix: one obviously-correct implementation
     instead of five chances to get the wrapping subtly wrong again.
  2. `dsse.py::verify_threshold` crashed with a bare `TypeError`
     ("unhashable type: 'list'") when a signature entry's attacker-
     controlled `keyid` field was a JSON list or dict, since `keyid not
     in authorized_keys` requires a hashable key. Fixed with an explicit
     `isinstance(keyid, str)` guard before the lookup.
  3. `snapshot.py`'s "unexpected snapshot document type" error message
     unconditionally called `parsed.get("tessera")` even when `parsed`
     wasn't a dict. The `or`-chain condition it sat inside correctly
     short-circuited the CHECK, but not the error message construction
     underneath the `raise`. Fixed by splitting into two sequential
     `if`/`raise` statements instead of one combined condition.
- **D42** Re-pinning a local alias to a NEW fingerprint (the root-key-
  compromise recovery drill, D37) surfaced a real bug: `state.json`
  (rollback/equivocation high-water marks) and cached root/manifest
  envelopes are keyed by the LOCAL ALIAS NAME, not by fingerprint, so a
  re-pin silently carried the OLD identity's high-water marks over and
  compared them against the NEW, unrelated publisher's own genuinely
  fresh state. This was observed as a false "equivocation" the moment the new
  publisher's first-ever timestamp happened to land on a seq number the
  old one had already reached. This would have broken the one documented
  recovery procedure for root key compromise in practice. Fixed:
  `trust_store.add_pin` now clears `state.json`, the cached root
  envelope, and cached manifests whenever a pin's fingerprint actually
  changes; a same-fingerprint re-pin (e.g. just updating the mirror list)
  is unaffected.
